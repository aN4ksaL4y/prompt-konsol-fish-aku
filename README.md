# Fish Shell Prompt with Hacker News Fetcher

This script is a Fish shell configuration that customizes the shell prompt and provides system information along with the top Hacker News stories. It includes:
- A function to fetch and display the top 7 stories from Hacker News with caching.
- Display of system information such as RAM usage, top CPU consumers, and the current date.
- A Git integration to show the current branch when inside a Git repository.
- A customized Fish prompt with user and directory information.

## Features

### 1. **Fetch Top Hacker News Stories with Caching**
- The `fetch_hacker_news` function retrieves the top 7 stories from Hacker News using the Hacker News Firebase API.
- The fetched titles are cached for 1 hour to avoid unnecessary network requests.
- If the cached data is less than 1 hour old, it is displayed from the cache.
  
### 2. **System Information**
- Displays current RAM usage.
- Lists the top 5 processes consuming CPU resources.
- Displays the current date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.

### 3. **Fish Shell Prompt**
- The prompt displays the user, hostname, current directory, and the current Git branch (if inside a Git repository).
- A custom red `âžœ` prompt symbol is used, with a blinking block cursor.
